Hi! Welcome to my personal website. In this project, I'll be refining my skills of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by creating a website for my passions. By blending my technical *and* non-technical passions, I'm hoping this will spur further learning and motivation :)



**Developer Log:**

11/1/2023 - 11/2/2023:
  * Created index.html, styles.css, and app.js
  * Began thinking about how to structure the website for responsiveness and maximal code reuse.
